Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about rational functions. It's divided into a toss-up and a bonus. Let me start with the toss-up.

The toss-up is a multiple-choice question: If \( f(x) = \frac{3x^2}{x^2 - 4} \), what is the horizontal asymptote? The options are W: \( y = 0 \), X: \( y = \frac{3}{2} \), Y: \( y = 3 \), Z: \( y = 5 \).

Alright, I remember that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. If the degrees are the same, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. In this case, both the numerator and the denominator are degree 2. The leading coefficient of the numerator is 3, and the denominator's leading coefficient is 1. So, the horizontal asymptote should be \( y = \frac{3}{1} = 3 \). That means the answer is Y: \( y = 3 \).

Now, onto the bonus question. It's a short answer: Given \( f(x) = \frac{2x^3 + 4x}{x^2 - 2x + 5} \), what is the oblique asymptote?

I recall that oblique asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than the degree of the denominator. In this case, the numerator is degree 3, and the denominator is degree 2, so there should be an oblique asymptote, which is a linear function.

To find it, I need to perform polynomial long division of \( 2x^3 + 4x \) by \( x^2 - 2x + 5 \).

Let me set it up:

Divide \( 2x^3 \) by \( x^2 \) to get \( 2x \). Multiply the entire divisor \( x^2 - 2x + 5 \) by \( 2x \), which gives \( 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x \). Subtract this from the original numerator:

\( (2x^3 + 0x^2 + 4x) - (2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x) = 0x^3 + 4x^2 - 6x \).

Now, bring down the next term, but since there are no more terms, the new dividend is \( 4x^2 - 6x \). Divide \( 4x^2 \) by \( x^2 \) to get \( +4 \). Multiply the divisor by 4: \( 4x^2 - 8x + 20 \). Subtract this from the current dividend:

\( (4x^2 - 6x) - (4x^2 - 8x + 20) = 0x^2 + 2x - 20 \).

So, the division yields \( 2x + 4 \) with a remainder of \( 2x - 20 \). Therefore, the function can be written as:

\( f(x) = 2x + 4 + \frac{2x - 20}{x^2 - 2x + 5} \).

The oblique asymptote is the polynomial part, which is \( 2x + 4 \).

I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again:

1. Divided \( 2x^3 \) by \( x^2 \) to get \( 2x \).
2. Multiplied \( x^2 - 2x + 5 \) by \( 2x \) to get \( 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x \).
3. Subtracted to get \( 4x^2 - 6x \).
4. Then divided \( 4x^2 \) by \( x^2 \) to get \( +4 \).
5. Multiplied the divisor by 4 to get \( 4x^2 - 8x + 20 \).
6. Subtracted to get the remainder \( 2x - 20 \).

Everything checks out. So, the oblique asymptote is indeed \( 2x + 4 \).

I think I've got it right. The horizontal asymptote is \( y = 3 \), and the oblique asymptote is \( y = 2x + 4 \).

Alright, I need to tackle this question about derivative tests. Let's start with the toss-up question, which is multiple choice. The question is about identifying which condition indicates a local maximum using the second derivative test. The options are concave up, concave down, increasing, and decreasing.

First, I recall that the second derivative test helps determine the concavity of a function at a critical point. If the second derivative is positive at a critical point, the function is concave up there, which means it's a local minimum. Conversely, if the second derivative is negative, the function is concave down at that point, indicating a local maximum. 

Given this, the correct answer should be concave down, which corresponds to option Y. 

Moving on to the bonus question, it's a short answer question. It asks for the term when the first derivative is zero and changes from positive to negative. 

I remember that the first derivative being zero indicates a critical point. If the first derivative changes from positive to negative, the function transitions from increasing to decreasing. This behavior is characteristic of a local maximum. 

So, the answer to the bonus question is "maximum."

I need to ensure that both questions are correctly formatted and that the answers are accurate. For the toss-up, the options are labeled W, X, Y, Z, and the correct answer is Y. For the bonus, it's a short answer, so the response should be just one word.

I think these questions are appropriate for the intended purpose, testing specific knowledge about derivative tests without requiring a calculator.
