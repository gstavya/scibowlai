{"messages": [{"role": "user","content": "A crude approximation is that the Earth travels in a circular orbit about the Sun at constant speed, at a distance of 150,000,000 km from the Sun. Which of the following is the closest for the acceleration of the Earth in this orbit? (A) exactly 0 m/s2 (B) 0.006 m/s2 (C) 0.6 m/s2 (D) 6 m/s2 (E) 10 m/s2"},{"role": "assistant","content": "In this approximation, the Earth’s speed is constant, so you may be tricked into thinking that its acceleration is 0. It is not, however, because its velocity is not constant: its magnitude is constant (speed), but its direction keeps changing. It can be shown that the acceleration needed to keep an object on a circular trajectory is always directed towards the center of the circle (that is why we call it radial, or central, or centripetal acceleration) and its magnitude is ac = v^2 / r. We can determine v from the circumference of the Earth’s orbit and its orbital period, i.e., the duration of Earth’s year: v = 2πr/T = 2π · 150 · 10^6 km / 365.25 days ≈ 30 km/s (yes, that’s roughly how fast we are circling the Sun!), so ac = 0.006 m/s2, and the answer is B."}]}
