To be specific, let us consider the spring between the mass at the top of Figure 2 and the mass on the bottom left. Let us focus on what happens at the top mass. From Figure 3 we see that 2F cos 30° = Fc ⇒ F = Fc/√3. The same analysis holds for the other end of our spring, where another force with magnitude F = Fc/√3 acts to stretch our spring. Recall that in Problem 2011.9 we discussed a similar situation, with two equal magnitude forces stretching a spring.

Thus, the time of flight is minimized at the maximum velocity and lowest possible angle θ such that the ball can reach Wes. Considering the effects of changing the two parameters: As vmax increases, this allows for a greater velocity and lower angle, so the minimum value of t decreases. Conversely, as l increases, a greater minimum angle is required (and thus a lower horizontal velocity), so the minimum value of t increases. For the maximum value of t, t is proportional to the vertical component of the ball’s initial velocity (t = 2v sin θ/g). Therefore, we should try to maximize the initial velocity of the ball, as well as its angle. If vmax increases, this increases the maximum value of t, but as l increases, the maximum value of t decreases due to the throw requiring a less steep angle.

Meanwhile, the force of buoyancy is equal in magnitude to the weight of displaced water W, by Archimedes’ Principle. To find this, we can use the density ratio given in the problem. If ρw is the density of water and ρr is the density of the rod, we have that W = (ρw/ρr)Mg(1 - l/L). The buoyant force acts at the midpoint of the portion of the rod under the water, which is distance (L + l)/2 from the pivot. Then, the torque from buoyancy has magnitude τb = W cos θ · (L + l)/2 = (ρw/ρr)Mg cos θ(1 - l/L) · (L + l)/2. These torques must balance, so τg = τb ⇒ L/2 = (ρw/ρr)(1 - l/L)(L + l)/2. Dividing by L/2 and rearranging yields ρr/ρw = (1 - l/L)/(1 + l/L) = 1 - (l/L)^2, l/L = sqrt(1 - ρr/ρw) = sqrt(1 - 5/9) = 2/3. Thus, the answer is D."}]}

The normal force balances out the combined perpendicular components of gravity and P, so N = W cos θ + P sin θ. Then, the force of kinetic friction on the block has magnitude Fk = μN = μ(W cos θ + P sin θ). Now we can turn our attention to the parallel components. These must balance for the block to remain moving at a constant speed, so P cos θ − Fk − W sin θ = 0 ⇒ P cos θ = μ(W cos θ + P sin θ) + W sin θ.

The correct answer choice is E. Note: Let us comment on the answer choice C. While it is true that Kepler’s First Law allows parabolas and hyperbolas, the true trajectory in this case must be an ellipse, because we are told that the particle will fall back to the planet, so it has a bound trajectory.

Rather, if the original compression was by amount h, the change in spring energy after additional compression x will be ∆Es = 1 2 k(h + x) 2 − 1 2 kh2 = 1 2 kx2 + khx. The term khx is due to the quadratic dependence of the spring’s energy on its compression. Let m1 = 2 kg, y = 5 m, m2 = 6 kg, and k = 72 N/m. Let us first determine the original compression h of the spring, before the collision. Let “up” be the positive direction. Since m2 was originally in equilibrium, its weight is balanced by the restoring force of the spring Fs = −kh Fs − m2g = 0 ⇒ − kh = m2g ⇒ h = − m2g k = −0.833 m. Next, we can get the speed of m1 just before the collision with m2 from conservation of energy: mgy = mv2 2 ⇒ v = p 2gy = 10 m/s. The collision is completely inelastic so the speed of the merged object is w = m1v m1 + m2 = m1 √ 2gy m1 + m2 = 2.5 m/s. Finally, we use conservation of energy between the moment right after the collision and the moment when the merged body is at its lowest point, i.e., at displacement x < 0 with respect to the position of m2 before the collision. The total energy E(1) right after the collision consisted of • Kinetic energy E (1) k = (m1+m2)w2 2 • Spring potential energy E (1) s = 1 2 kh2 • Gravitational potential energy E (1) p = 0 (i.e., we choose this to be the zero-level) The total energy E(2) at the moment the merged object is at its lowest point (with displacement x < 0 from the original position and speed 0) is • Kinetic energy E (2) k = 0 • Spring potential energy E (2) s = 1 2 k(h + x) 2 • Gravitational potential energy E (2) p = (m1 + m2)gx (we are now below zero-level, so x < 0 and E (2) p < 0) Finally, from E(1) = E(2) we find (m1 + m2)w 2 2 + 1 2 kh2 = 1 2 k(h + x) 2 + (m1 + m2)gx (m1 + m2)w 2 2 + 1 2 kh2 = 1 2 kh2 + khx + 1 2 kx2 + (m1 + m2)gx. We can simplify this further by noticing that m2g = −kh: (m1 + m2)w 2 2 = 1 2 kx2 + m1gx. (1) Equation (1) is quadratic in displacement x with only one negative solution: 36x 2 + 20x − 25 = 0 ⇒ x = −1.156 m. The problem is asking for the magnitude (absolute value) of this displacement, so the best answer is B. Note 1: Had we not taken into account the quadratic nature of the spring’s potential energy, we would naively write an equation very similar to Equa- tion (1), except that in the right-most term we would have m1 + m2 instead of just m1. When done properly, it is as if m2 is weightless – its weight is balanced by the spring. Note 2: A very interesting question about this problem was asked by a student in our class: Couldn’t we simply consider the balance of the spring force and gravity, (m1 +m2)g = kx, which yields x = (m1 +m2)g/k = 1.11 m, the correct answer? Unfortunately, the answer is no, because balancing of forces works to find the equilibrium positions, and here we are dealing with the extreme position of oscillations, when the forces are not balanced. The only approach that works here is the conservation of energy. The fact that a wrong approach produced the correct result was purely a coincidence. If the given values were different, for example, if m2 = 1 kg, the two results would be quite different. This can be seen from the two formulas resulting from the two approaches: |x| = m1g k 1 + s 1 + 2ky (m1 + m2)g ! and |x| = (m1 + m2)g k ."}]}

In that case only the linear momentum is conserved m1v1 + m2v2 = m1w1 + m2w2 and objects get merged, so w1 = w2 = w. In that case w = m1v1 + m2v2 m1 + m2. Back to our problem, with v2 = 0, we find that for elastic collisions r2 = w2 v1 = 2m1 m1 + m2 = 2 1 + α , while for perfectly inelastic collisions we have r2 = w2 v1 = m1 m1 + m2 = 1 1 + α . In this sense, all other collisions (partially inelastic collisions) lie between these two extremes7 and in general 1 1 + α ≤ r2 ≤ 2 1 + α , which is answer E."}]}
